					A little bit of backstory:
					<br />
					In May 12021 i got the offer to participate in a 1.5 month volunteering project in Tbilisi, Georgia. After a
					month of thinking and lots of stressful nights, i accepted the offer.
					<br />
					After all, this was probably a one in a lifetime chance and it was a great opportunity for me to learn living
					on my own and being independent.
					<br />
					<br />
					Fast forward to July 2 nighttime and i landed in Tbilisi together with 5 other volunteers from Sweden.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					A little bit about the project:
					<br />
					The youth organization DRONI together with the European Solidarity Corporation(ESC) have created project The
					sky is the limit. The project is about bringing young adults ranging in age from 18 to 30 to Georgia to help
					make positive difference. My role in the project is to raise awareness about our environment and teach locals
					to recycle. We have other volunteers from other european countries as well who have different tasks in the
					project. together we try to make the world a better place.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					Update on day +10:
					<br />
					At the time I'm writing this, I've been in Georgia for a week and 3 days. Everything is going well and I'm
					getting used to this country. I've started to remember the routes and "live normally". We've started work in
					the office and things are going smoothly and nominally. Last tuesday we all went to a restaurant and got to
					try Georgian foods khinkali and khachapuri and they were pretty yummy! I've also been finding a lot of
					international friends here which is a big plus for me! Tomorrow our Italian roommate/volunteer leaves and our
					German volunteer leaves this saturday so that's a big bummer :(
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					Update on day +14:
					<br />
					This week has been the busiest week of my life! We had 2 events this week, one on wednesday and one on
					thursday. On wednesday we had a presentation about recycling in a youth center, and on thursday we had a
					Swedish cultural night. We spent most of the week preparing and planning the events and it was quite
					stressful.
					<br />
					Our German volunteer who has been really helpful and a good friend is leaving tomorrow so this afternoon has
					been a little sad for me. I will for sure miss Ghambashidze being busy and full of events.
					<br />
					I'll probably get my own room now that Chiara and Marlene are gone, but the apartment will be lonely with only
					Daniil, Marie, Djem and I.
					<br />
					<br />
					Other than that everything is going really well with the Swedish crew and our projects. We've learned to work
					together and we have a great teamwork.
