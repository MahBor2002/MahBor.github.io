					My name is Mahdad Borhani. i try to learn new things on my own and try to teach them to others. I have a
					strong interest in astronomy, spaceflight, physics, programming, robotics, electronics and mechanics. My other
					interests include chemistry, biology, engineering, philosophy and other general science. I love looking at
					something and knowing the exact mechanics of how it works. I love finding answers to both big important and
					also silly questions. questions like why the sky is blue, why plants are green, why living organisms don't
					have wheels, how gravitation works(it's not how people think it is), how to tile pavements better, how drivers
					navigate, why smoke is white, how thinking works, how trees lure animals and many more questions. These
					questions make me see the world in a much more beautiful way. I've been told i see the world slightly
					differently than how others see it.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					I currently work on some programming, learning and teaching. I learn programming, physics, rocket design,
					chemistry, engineering, robotics, electronics, CAD and modeling.
					<br />
					For the past 3.5 years I've been working on my ATP program. APT stands for Astronaut Training Program and is
					my biggest and longest on-going project. More about my projects can be found on the projects tab at the top of
					this webpage.
					<br />
					<br />
					<br />
					Visit my YouTube, Twitter or Github page down bellow to follow my projects more closely and feel free to
					contact me from my contact page for questions, ideas, marketing, bug reports or anything else you would want
					to tell me!
					<br />
					<br />
					Looking forward to hearing from you,
					<br />
					<br />
					Mahdad Borhani
