My First Website

This repository is about my first ever website! This website is mostly a learning pathfinder for me, and does not serve a real purpose, But it is a great place for me to talk about my projects, thoughts and the things i am currently working on.


I plan on writing about my projects and sharing my knowledge with everyone for free, so more people can engage with science and possibly take the next big leap for (hu)mankind

As i said, this website is mostly for internal uses and therefor, i have written most things in an "internal-mode". For example, the years in dates are "12021" instead of "2021". This is an internal-mode text and i will write an article dedicated to this soon.

I will update this repo as often as i can, but keep in mind, this is a learning path for me, and it might be a while before my next big update.
